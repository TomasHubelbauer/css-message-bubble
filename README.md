# CSS Mesage Bubble

In this repository I try to figure out a CSS only way to get a message bubble with the following behavior:

[**DEMO**](https://tomashubelbauer.github.io/css-message-bubble)

- When the message and stamp fit both on the same line, have them share the line and align the stamp to the right
- When they cannot both fit on the same line, have the text take full width (of possibly multiple lines)
    - The stamp sits on its own line
    - Even if the last line of the text is short enough to have been able to fit the stamp, the stamp still has its own line

## To-Do
